- Ann Arbor parking is limited/expensive
- Too many cars
- Uber/lyft are expensive and not oriented for scheduled carpool riders (long-term)
- Busses don't go everywhere
- Create a platform for people to look "long-term" carpool partners
- Closely collaborate with companies/ city governement that are having a traffic issues
